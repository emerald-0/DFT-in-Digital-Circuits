This two character code is used to specify a fault class.

DT - Detected

   DR - Detected Robustly
   DS - Detected by Simulation
   DI - Detected by Implication
   D2 - Detected clock fault with loadable nonscan cell faulty value of 0 and 1 
   TP - Transition partially detected 

PT - Possibly Detected

   AP - ATPG Untestable possibly Detected
   NP - Not Analyzed, Possibly Detected
   P0 - Detected clock fault and loadable nonscan faulty value is 0
   P1 - Detected clock fault and loadable nonscan faulty value is 1

UD - Undetectable 
 
   UU - Undetectable Unused
   UO - Undetectable Unobservable
   UT - Undetectable Tied
   UB - Undetectable Blocked
   UR - Undetectable Redundant

AU - ATPG Untestable

   AN - ATPG Untestable Not-Detected
   AX - ATPG Untestable Timing Exceptions

ND - Not Detected

   NC - Not Controlled
   NO - Not Observed
