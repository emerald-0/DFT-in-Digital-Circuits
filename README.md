**#DFT in Digital Circuits**
- Developed and implemented Design for Testability (DFT) techniques for AES file processors, ensuring efficient
testing and validation of encryption and decryption operations.
- Improved testability and observability of digital circuits by implementing scan chains, boundary scan, and built-in
self-test (BIST) techniques.
